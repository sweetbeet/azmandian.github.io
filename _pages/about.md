Hi! My name is Maryam and I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at Northwestern University.
I’m interested in robotics (Human-Robot Interaction and swarms), and the current project I’m working on is implementing a distributed swarm localization system using AprilTags to replace the current Vive system.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

 This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
